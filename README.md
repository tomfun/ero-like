## Project setup

The only thing you have to install before running the first command is "docker-compose". If its first time you run it, possible you face sockets permissions problem. The working solution was just printing "sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock", probably it's not the best one.

1. for local development setup db:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

2. Go to *api* and follow instructions
3. Go to *my-vue3-app* and follow instructions
